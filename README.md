**B. Dataset Information**

**Source**

- Supply Chain DataSet (from Kaggle)

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amirmotefaker/supply-chain-dataset/data

**C. Methodoly**

- SQLit: Validated data completeness
    + Column types: No anomaly ‚Üí Pass
    + %Blank/null: 0% for all columns ‚Üí Pass
    + %Zero Value for numeric columns: 0-1% for all columns ‚Üí Pass
    + Outlier for numeric columns: Min - Max within reasonable range
- Power BI: Built dashboards to analyze .

**D. Key Findings & Actionable Plans**

- Profit Margin = 90.8% (well above 70% target) ‚Üí performance is excellent  
- Costs are stable within expected thresholds  
- Inspection Results: Fail 23%, Pending 41% ‚Üí product quality inconsistent, QC process too slow  
- Availability = 48.4% (industry benchmark 80‚Äì90%) ‚Üí stock readiness is low.

**_Actionable Plans_**

- Inspection Improvement:
  + Standardize SOPs & QC checkpoints  
  + Enhance employee training  
  + Root cause analysis for failures  
  + Supplier reassessment.
- Inventory Optimization:
  + Apply demand forecasting (Version 2 of this Project with time-series data)
  + Collaborate with suppliers to reduce lead times.

**E. Lesson Learned**

- Not every dataset contains errors or anomalies, sometimes the data is already clean and the KPIs look strong.
- In such cases, the analyst‚Äôs role is to validate completeness, confirm stability, and provide transparency rather than ‚Äúfixing‚Äù issues.
- Business value is not only about finding problems but also about confirming that operations are running well.
- Enhancements (scenario analysis, predictive modeling) should be driven either by specific business questions from stakeholders or by the analyst‚Äôs own initiative to explore further (predictive analysis - would be build in the next versions)

**VERSION 2: PREDICTIVE ANALYSIS**

**A. Project Overview**

- Extended the project with a demand forecasting model to support the action plan from Version 1 (Inventory Optimization), using time series sales data to predict future demand and improve stock availability.
- Number of Pieces Predictive to become the base for optimizing inventory.

**B. Dataset Information**

**Source**

- Since the original supply chain dataset did not contain time-series sales records, a new synthetic dataset with historical sales data was used to build and validate the forecasting model.
- Time Series Supply Chain Dataset (from Kaggle)

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/philiphyde1/time-series-supply-chain-dataset/data?

**Period**

- Between 2020 to 2025

**C. Methodology**

- Define forecast variable: NumberOfPieces, aggregated weekly
- Data preprocessing:
  + Convert type of WorkDate to datetime
  + Resample by week (main), also by day and month for comparison
  + Group by Customer & Location
- Split dataset into Train (2020‚Äì2024) and Test (2025)
- Baseline Models: Naive Forecast, Holt-Winters
- Time-series Models: SARIMA, Prophet

**D. Key Findings & Actionable Plans**

**_Key Findings_**
- Naive Forecast:
  + Forecast for the next period equals the last observed value.
  + While simple to implement, it ignores both trend and seasonality.
‚Üí Naive forecast serves only as a baseline reference, useful for comparison but not reliable for decision-making.
- Holt-Winters:
  + Captured both trend and yearly seasonality by applying level, trend, and seasonal smoothing components.
  + It improved accuracy compared to Naive but lagged behind advanced models when data showed strong fluctuations and irregularities.
‚Üí Holt-Winters provides a reasonable improvement over Naive and can be used for short-term forecasting, but it is less precise for complex supply chain patterns.
- SARIMA Result:
  + The SARIMA model was tuned through grid search and identified the best parameters as SARIMA(1,1,1)(1,1,0,52).
  + The model achieved an AIC of ~3092 and a MAPE of ~14% on the 2025 test set, indicating a reasonably accurate forecast.
  + Diagnostic checks confirmed that residuals have no significant autocorrelation, though they deviate from perfect normality, which is common in real-world time series.
‚Üí SARIMA provides robust predictive performance, making it suitable for operational planning. With a forecast error of ~14%, it can guide inventory and supply chain decisions with high reliability.
- Prophet Result:
  + The Prophet model was trained on the same weekly data and produced forecasts for 2025 with a MAPE of ~19%.
  + Prophet visualizations highlighted a clear upward trend across years and seasonality patterns: demand typically dips around mid-year (May‚ÄìJuly) and peaks at year-end (November‚ÄìDecember).
  + The forecast intervals (yhat_lower, yhat_upper) provide transparency into uncertainty, which is valuable for risk-aware planning.
‚Üí Prophet is highly effective for communicating trends and seasonality to stakeholders. It complements SARIMA by making forecasts more explainable and visually intuitive, even if the precision is slightly lower.

**_Actionable Plans_**

- Adopt **SARIMA** as the primary forecasting engine for inventory planning.  
- Use **Prophet** mainly for communication and visualization, helping management easily understand long-term trends and seasonality.  
‚Üí Both methods are consistent: SARIMA ensures accuracy for operations, while Prophet enhances stakeholder engagement and explainability.
